- Background color: Soft off-white (#FAF9F6), provides a clean and inviting backdrop, ensuring the focus remains on the recipes.
- Accent color: Light orange (#FFB74D), an analogous color to the primary, used sparingly for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, to create a contemporary but approachable feel for recipes and instructions.
- Use clear, minimalist icons that represent cooking actions, ingredients, and settings.
- Employ a card-based layout for recipes to promote a visually clean and organized interface, facilitating easy content discovery and navigation on various devices.
- Subtle transition animations and visual cues (e.g., a recipe card 'flipping' to reveal more details, a loading spinner made of swirling food items) to acknowledge user interaction and maintain interest.
